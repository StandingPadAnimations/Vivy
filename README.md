# Vivy
A fork of MCprep that gives more control to the user

# Why?
I'm an MCprep maintainer, so it might seem strange that I would make a fork of MCprep, but hear me out for a bit.

MCprep is an amazing addon, and it has enabled the community to make Minecraft animations and renders in Blender. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for MCprep.

However, MCprep's design goals are mainly to appeal to a less advanced userbase. There's nothing wrong with that, but it severely restricts its ability for advanced users. That's where Vivy comes in.

Vivy is a fork of MCprep, so any improvements MCprep has Vivy will gain, **but** Vivy aims to appeal to advanced users through control. MCprep doesn't give much control to the user, which is fine for most, but not all. Vivy aims to appeal to those that want more control.

## If you're an MCprep Maintainer, then why a fork?
The features Vivy aims to add would have one or more of the following:
- Not easy to turn into a simple UI 
- Creates issues for non-advanced users
- Too niche

As such, it's simply easier to make a fork, and implement those features in said fork; the stuff Vivy plans to do would clash with MCprep's design goals. Contrary to popular belief, forks don't mean all out war, and in this case are a win-win for all involved.

# Why the name Vivy?
It's based off of a light novel I got and I thought it was a nice name, hence the name Vivy for this project :D
